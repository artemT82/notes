# notes
###Simple React.js SPA for managing your notes

####You can:
* Add notes
* Delete notes
* Search for notes (search field appears after you've created more than one note)

####Requirements
In order to run this app in any modern browser you should set up a plain web-server. I recommend to use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). This process won't take any longer then 5 mins for you

####Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by [this course](https://github.com/krambertech/react-essential-course). You definitely should check it out
